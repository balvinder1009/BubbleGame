# BubbleGame
This is a bubble game developed using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. A timer will start at 60 upon game load, and a random target number will be displayed. According to that, a bubble has to be selected, and if the selected bubble matches the hit number, the score will be increased by 10 points, and thus the game will go on until the timer reaches zero.
